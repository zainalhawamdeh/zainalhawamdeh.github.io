            This carbonara recipe is a quick and cozy dish that's perfect 
            for any weeknight dinner. The creamy sauce, crispy beef bacon, 
            and tender pasta come together in the best way, with a pop of 
            green peas for a little extra freshness. It's simple to make 
            but tastes like you put in a lot of effort—just the kind of 
            recipe I love to share!

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                12 ounces spaghetti, fettuccine, or tagliatelle
            </li>
            <li>
                2 whole eggs
            </li>
            <li>
                4 egg yolks
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                8 ounces beef bacon, cut into small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons minced garlic
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 to 2/3 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking the 
                pasta)
            </li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup green peas (optional)
            </li>
            <li>
                salt, to taste
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Pasta:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to 
                a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package 
                instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the 
                pasta water before draining.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a large bowl, whisk together 
                the eggs, egg yolks, freshly grated parmesan, and black 
                pepper until smooth and well combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Bacon:</b> In a large skillet over medium heat, 
                cook the beef bacon with garlic and brown sugar until 
                crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the cooked bacon to a 
                bowl on the side, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combine Bacon Fat with Egg Mixture:</b> Carefully pour 
                the hot bacon fat into the bowl with the egg and parmesan 
                mixture, whisking constantly to combine. Then, temper the 
                egg mixture by slowly adding a bit of the reserved pasta 
                water at a time until you get a creamy thick consistency, 
                whisking to avoid scrambling the eggs. Don't add all the 
                pasta water or your sauce will be too thin. You can always 
                add more later.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Carbonara:</b> Pour the tempered egg mixture 
                back into the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring 
                constantly until the sauce thickens and becomes creamy. 
                Note: Stir well and make sure the heat is not too high to 
                prevent the sauce from curdling.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combine and Serve:</b> Add the cooked pasta back to the 
                pan with the sauce. Toss everything together until the 
                pasta is well coated. Then, add the cooked bacon and green 
                peas, mixing until well combined. Season with salt and 
                additional black pepper to taste. Serve immediately with 
                extra parmesan if desired. Enjoy!
