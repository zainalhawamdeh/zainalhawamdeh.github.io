            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]
            </sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> 
            or <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon 
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked 
            trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like 
            gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>
            [7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
            adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced 
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            If the 
            crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, 
            they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains 
            instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. 
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in 
            conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, 
            stands of 
            flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
            flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> 
            According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches 
            greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
