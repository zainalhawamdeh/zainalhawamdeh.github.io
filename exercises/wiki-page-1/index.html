            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]
            </sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> 
            or <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon 
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked 
            trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like 
            gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> The 
            phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but 
            also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>
            [7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
            adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
