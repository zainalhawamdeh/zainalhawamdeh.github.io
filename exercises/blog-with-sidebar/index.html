                        It’s time to finally review this mastodon of a game 
                        after giving it around 150 hours on one-and-a-half 
                        playthroughs. For the most part, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a 
                        fine addition to the CRPG genre, and Dungeons & Dragons 
                        games overall. However, it’s not without issues, and 
                        issues it has aplenty. This rest on more than just 
                        gameplay and story, unfortunately, since there is a 
                        lot of polarizing content in it that takes the form 
                        of the current progressive zeitgeist. Your level of 
                        tolerance will affect your enjoyment of Baldur’s Gate 3,
                        unless you are a firm believer, and sees this game as 
                        some kind of triumph furthering the cause – like 
                        mainstream gaming journalists. More on that later.

                <p id="intro-paragraph-2">
                    Let’s start with the story, and there will be some spoilers 
                    here on out, so beware. I wouldn’t be able to get some 
                    important points across otherwise, but I will try to keep 
                    it at a minimum. The game starts very bombastic with a 
                    nautiloid (mind flayer) ship appearing above the city of 
                    Baldur’s Gate. It is being hunted by dragon riders from 
                    the githyanki race (a race not native to Faerun) so this 
                    isn’t exactly a friendly visit over a cup of tea. While 
                    flying over the city the nautiloid decides to kidnap a 
                    few people by teleporting them into mind-flayer-converting 
                    pods, and it’s here where you come in. See, you are 
                    one of these people that get wisped away and when onboard 
                    you are force-fed a tadpole through the eye – it’s all 
                    very pleasant, I promise.
                </p>
                <p id="intro-paragraph-3">
                    The attacks by the githyanki continue during this event, 
                    which eventually forces the nautiloid to a brutal 
                    crash-landing, and with that, the “tutorial island” is 
                    over. After just barely surviving the impact, you begin 
                    the real adventure on a beach, as a level one with nothing 
                    more to you than your name. It’s all very typical of 
                    Larian Studios. From here on out you will have to 
                    figure out what happened, and why, and a way to remove the
                    mind worm before it turns you into a mind flayer.

                <p id="intro-paragraph-4">
                    Baldur’s Gate 3 story is structured into 3 massive acts, 
                    each with its own separate storyline and ending. The acts 
                    do still have a connection with each other as you continue 
                    to pursue the reason why you were kidnapped in the first 
                    place and to find a way to remove the mind worm – which is 
                    a constant conundrum throughout the game. The story works 
                    and it’s intriguing and mysterious, but it does have some 
                    huge issues. First off, the connection to the original 
                    games is flimsy at best since Baldur’s Gate 3 is set 
                    about 100 years after the Bhaal spawn incident. There are 
                    references, and you even get a meet a few characters from 
                    past games. However, it does feel more like fanservice than 
                    anything else. I found this disappointing, and while it’s 
                    still fun meeting the old characters, it’s a letdown since 
                    they have no real impact on the story at large. They also 
                    feel a bit odd on the verve of being poorly written 
                    compared to their older parts, especially everything 
                    involving the good old god of murder.

                    <p id="intro-paragraph-5">
                        The narrative structure, pacing, and reason to care 
                        about anything is also a bit strange. The quest about 
                        the mind worm feels very urgent narrative-wise, yet 
                        you still have all the time in the world to meander 
                        around and do whatever you want. As a reminder, you 
                        are just some random dude getting picked in Baldur’s 
                        Gate, which doesn’t exactly scream 
                        “<span id="bold">
                            call of adventure
                        </span>“. 
                        You are here just to survive while forced together with 
                        a motley crew of castaways. There is no real incentive 
                        to actually do anything that is expected from a 
                        roleplaying fantasy game. Why go explore some random 
                        dungeon when you have a worm in your brain ready to 
                        transform you? And why in gods name does the rest of 
                        the crew follow you down into these crypts? They don’t 
                        even like you, and you probably don’t like them much.

                <p>
                    Another issue that ties into this is that you don’t enter 
                    the city of Baldur’s Gate until the final act. It treats 
                    you as a newcomer even when most backgrounds have you as a 
                    citizen of the city. You are also expected to care about 
                    the city, as apparently it will be destroyed in a gruesome 
                    way in the game’s crescendo if you are not there to stop 
                    it. Why would you care about any of this, though? That’s 
                    what I mean by the structure of the game feels strange. 
                    A solution to this would be to set the first few levels 
                    in Baldur’s Gate – to get a chance to know the city, to 
                    be able to craft an identity for your character, and why 
                    not make a few friends, maybe even a companion or two that 
                    follow you through the ordeal. Imagine making a triumphant 
                    return if this was the case, instead of just walking into 
                    an unknown city with the expectation that you should care 
                    dearly about this place, a place you know nothing about and 
                    has no attachment to. As it is, it feels very artificial 
                    and forced.

                <h4 id="link-2">So many villains</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond all the minor bosses you will dispatch through gory 
                    violence, all with their own short portrayal, there are 
                    just too many “main” villains in this story – from avatars 
                    of gods to fallen paladins and crazed Bhaal cultists. The 
                    main villains are not even introduced in the first act! 
                    There is nothing that propels you forward besides the 
                    tadpole stuck in your skull, and to be honest, the story 
                    and the motivations are a bit confusing – this combined 
                    with the meandering nature of the game makes for a hell of 
                    a long twisty experience. There is a pretty good mystery 
                    behind it all, but act one never makes it clear who the 
                    main bad guys are. Act 2 introduces one of the main 
                    villains and many underling bosses – and only for that 
                    act it should be pointed out, as after Act 2 most of them 
                    will be gone from the story forever. The antagonists never 
                    get a real chance to shine since they don’t follow you from 
                    act to act. With all this I mean; there is nobody like 
                    Sarevok or Jon Irenicus that is a constant thorn in your 
                    side. Well, except for the bad-guy cult called the 
                    Absolute. But considering how easy they are to infiltrate 
                    even as the purest of good souls, they stand out as a bunch 
                    of incompetent fools that are easily tricked. They never 
                    come off as a serious danger or a real antagonistic faction.
                </p>
                <h4 id="link-3">So many companions</h4>
                <p>
                    On companions, they are of the typical BioWare kind, or at 
                    least very inspired by that type of writing, however, for 
                    some reason they are written with the sexual appetite of 
                    Hugh Hefner, as everyone wants to bone you regardless of 
                    what sex you are. I talked about this in of my impression 
                    articles, so I won’t go into it too much, but it ruins 
                    every prospect of forming any kind of brotherhood 
                    (or sisterhood for that matter) since I doubt you could 
                    form that kind of connection when you need to establish a 
                    HR department just to take a rest in the wilderness. 
                    Past that, the companions are okay, but not overly 
                    interesting, and one fault in this (besides the writing 
                    trying to upstage BioWare companions at every turn) is 
                    that their backgrounds are just way too outlandish. In 
                    general, I don’t like the “chosen one” storyline, but if 
                    you play a custom “good” character as I did, the game gives 
                    you nothing except the tadpole lodged into your brain – an 
                    aspect your companions even share. See, all the companions 
                    have something going for them, something much bigger than 
                    the tadpole which (at least to them) makes the brain worm a 
                    minor issue compared. By playing a custom character, you 
                    are relegated to a nanny role for grown-ups, making sure 
                    their needs are met, so they can experience their part of 
                    the story. While you, the so-called main protagonist of the 
                    Baldur’s Gate 3 get nothing. There is no personal journey, 
                    no interesting quest to fulfill… zero, zip, nada. I can’t 
                    think I have ever experienced something like this in an RPG
                    before, but now that I have, it feels incredibly empty 
                    narrative-wise since any one of the companions can 
                    technically defeat the big bad without you.
