                    In a realm forgotten by history, 
                    <a href="#">humans</a>, 
                    <a href="#">elves</a>, 
                    <a href="#">halflings</a>
                    and other assorted races lived together in harmony in an 
                    untainted paradise surrounded by thick green forests and 
                    crystal clear streams. However, this tranquility was abruptly 
                    shattered by the roar of demons as the Dark Lord returned to 
                    reclaim his throne as the ruler of these lands. This set off 
                    a series of bloody battles as all races become ensnared in 
                    the violent conflict. 
                    <br><br>
                    After years of fierce fighting, the 
                    Dark Lord was eventually sealed away by the hands of as hero 
                    named Rulzult. However, the damage had been done. All the 
                    demon blood spilled during the war caused the land to become 
                    <a href="#">cursed</a> 
                    and the sky lost its light. This once serene paradise became 
                    known as "the Cursed Land." It entrapped its inhabitants and 
                    filled them with despair, causing each waking moment to feel 
                    like an eternity.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, a brave youth awakens in this land, 
                    unable to recall who he/she is and having no recollection of 
                    his/her past. The story continues, following the unknown youth 
                    on a journey of discovery to find his/her lost memories and 
                    determine the future of this forsaken land.

                    The player fights against monsters to obtain new items and 
                    equipment. Five races are available for your character: human, 
                    dwarf, halfling, elf, and machine. Additionally, four initial 
                    job classes are availableâ€”Fighter, Mage, Priest, and Thief. 
                    Additional job classes can be acquired through job cards 
                    dropped by monsters in certain areas; these include Anchor, 
                    Knight, Samurai, and Ninja. At any time, each character may 
                    pick up to two job subclasses in addition to their main job 
                    class, and certain attributes of that subclass will carry over 
                    into gameplay (such as a Fighter being able to cast spells 
                    with a Mage or Priest subclass). Actions during combat will 
                    change depending on the weapons equipped, and each of the 
                    numerous weapon types is only equipable to a certain subset 
                    of job classes. After building up a gauge through combat 
                    actions, a character can perform a special attack. Different 
                    special attacks can be performed when equipping different 
                    weapons.
