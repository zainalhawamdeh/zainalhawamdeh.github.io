                In a realm forgotten by history, 
                <a href="#">humans</a>, 
                <a href="#">elves</a>, 
                <a href="#">halflings</a>
                and other assorted races lived together in harmony in an 
                untainted paradise surrounded by thick green forests and 
                crystal clear streams. However, this tranquility was abruptly 
                shattered by the roar of demons as the Dark Lord returned to 
                reclaim his throne as the ruler of these lands. This set off 
                a series of bloody battles as all races become ensnared in 
                the violent conflict. 
                <br><br>
                After years of fierce fighting, the 
                Dark Lord was eventually sealed away by the hands of as hero 
                named Rulzult. However, the damage had been done. All the 
                demon blood spilled during the war caused the land to become 
                <a href="#">cursed</a> 
                and the sky lost its light. This once serene paradise became 
                known as "the Cursed Land." It entrapped its inhabitants and 
                filled them with despair, causing each waking moment to feel 
                like an eternity.
                <br><br>
                One day, a brave youth awakens in this land, 
                unable to recall who he/she is and having no recollection of 
                his/her past. The story continues, following the unknown youth 
                on a journey of discovery to find his/her lost memories and 
                determine the future of this forsaken land.
